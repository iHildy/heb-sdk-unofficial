title: Client Guide
description: Core methods and data shapes for the SDK.
---

This guide maps the main API surfaces in `heb-client`.
It also notes which calls require a bearer session and store context.

## Pick a session

Cookie sessions use web GraphQL and are good for cart, typeahead, store search, and shopping lists.
Bearer sessions use the mobile API and are required for the items below.

- Search and buy-it-again
- Product details and images
- Homepage content
- Account profile and addresses
- Orders and order details
- Weekly ad products

---

## Call core methods

The `HEBClient` class wraps all calls with a single session.
Set a store before calls that need pricing or availability.

- Search: `search`, `typeahead`, `getBuyItAgain`
- Products: `getProduct`, `getSkuId`, `getImageUrl`
- Cart: `getCart`, `addToCart`, `updateCartItem`, `removeFromCart`, `quickAdd`, `addToCartById`
- Orders: `getOrders`, `getOrder`
- Shopping lists: `getShoppingLists`, `getShoppingList`
- Stores and context: `searchStores`, `setStore`, `setShoppingContext`
- Fulfillment: `getDeliverySlots`, `getCurbsideSlots`, `reserveSlot`, `reserveCurbsideSlot`
- Homepage: `getHomepage`
- Weekly ad: `getWeeklyAdProducts`
- Account: `getAccountDetails`

```ts
const results = await heb.search("salsa", { limit: 5 })
const product = results.products[0]

if (product) {
  await heb.addToCartById(product.productId, 1)
}
```

## Use formatters

Formatting helpers return quick, display-ready strings.
Use the `formatter` object or the exported `formatX` functions.

```ts
import { formatter } from "heb-client"

const cart = await heb.getCart()
console.log(formatter.cart(cart))
```

---

## Work with types

Types are exported for all response shapes and inputs.
Common ones include `Product`, `Cart`, `ShoppingListDetails`, `FulfillmentSlot`, and `WeeklyAdResult`.

```ts
import type { Cart, Product } from "heb-client"
```

---

## Use low-level GraphQL

Reach for `graphqlRequest` or `persistedQuery` when you need an unsupported operation.
Operation names must exist in the persisted query hash list.

```ts
import { persistedQuery } from "heb-client"

const response = await persistedQuery(session, "typeaheadContent", { query: "milk" })
console.log(response.data)
```
