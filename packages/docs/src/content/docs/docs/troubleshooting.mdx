## Requests time out

- Confirm the session cookie is still valid.
- Retry with a smaller payload or lower page size.
- Check if the store context is missing.

## Auth refresh fails

- Verify refresh tokens were stored.
- Ensure your clock is synced for token expiry.
- Re-run the OAuth flow if tokens were revoked.

## MCP tool not found

- Confirm the tool is enabled in the MCP config.
- Restart the server after config changes.

Add real diagnostics once the SDK is wired up.
