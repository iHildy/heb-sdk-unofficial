description: Common fixes for session and context issues.
---

Most issues come from stale sessions or missing store context.
Use the checks below to narrow it down.

## Refresh sessions

401/403 responses or `UNAUTHORIZED` usually mean the session expired.
Refresh bearer tokens or renew the session credentials.

---

## Set a store

Errors like `No store selected` or `INVALID_PRODUCT_STORE` point to a missing store ID.
Call `setStore` or set `CURR_SESSION_STORE` before search, product, cart, homepage, and weekly ad calls.

---

## Use bearer tokens

Search, product details, homepage, account, orders, weekly ad, and buy-it-again require a bearer session.
If you are using cookies, switch to `createTokenSession` and try again.

---

## Check shopping context

If availability looks wrong, confirm the `shoppingContext` value.
Use `CURBSIDE_PICKUP`, `CURBSIDE_DELIVERY`, or `EXPLORE_MY_STORE`.

---

## Enable debug

Debug logging shows operation names and payloads.
Turn it on to confirm store IDs and query names.

```ts
heb.setDebug(true)
```
