---

## Plan a meal

- “I want to make dinner on Sunday. Let’s find the weekly deals for meat and some veggies and add them to my cart. Dinner for 4 people”

## Personalize

- “I’m getting back into town tomorrow morning, what should I order at H‑E‑B based on my order history?”

Tell your chat app to remember likes and dislikes, like “I don’t like green grapes.”
Memory features make future carts faster and more accurate.
