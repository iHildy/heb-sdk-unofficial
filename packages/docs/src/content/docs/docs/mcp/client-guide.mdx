## Sign in

You will be prompted to authenticate with Clerk when you add the server or after your first tool call.
Create an account with any username and password.

---

## Link your H‑E‑B account

After Clerk sign-in, go to `https://heb-mcp.hildy.io/connect` (if not already there) and click the H‑E‑B login link.

After logging in and approving access, copy the redirect URL (or authorization code) and paste it into `/connect`.

## Try it

Ask your assistant to run `heb_get_session_info` and confirm you see your account.
If it says missing session, revisit `/connect` and submit a new token.
