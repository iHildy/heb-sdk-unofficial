description: Add heb-mcp to Claude.ai or ChatGPT
---

Connect heb-mcp to an AI chat client that supports MCP.
You’ll need Developer mode enabled first.

---

## Enable developer mode

Open settings in Claude.ai or ChatGPT and turn on Developer mode.
After it reloads, you should see MCP server settings.

---

## Add a hosted endpoint

Use this path when you are running the remote HTTP service.
The client should discover OAuth from the server metadata.

- Server URL: `https://your-domain.example/mcp`
- Complete the OAuth sign-in flow when prompted
- Approve the requested scope, usually `mcp:tools`

---

## Add a local command

Use this if your client can launch local MCP processes.
The command must run in STDIO mode and keep running.

```json
{
  "command": "node",
  "args": ["/path/to/heb-mcp/dist/server.js"],
  "env": {
    "MCP_MODE": "local",
    "HEB_SAT": "your_sat_cookie",
    "HEB_REESE84": "your_reese84_cookie"
  }
}
```

If you prefer the cookie bridge, omit the cookie env vars and post cookies to http://localhost:4321/api/cookies.

---

## Confirm access

Run `heb_get_session_info` and check that the session is valid and a store is set.
If you see a missing-session message, link a session first.

---

## Link your account

Hosted mode: open `https://your-domain.example/connect` and sign in with Clerk.
Finish the H‑E‑B OAuth flow in the new tab and paste the code when asked.

Local mode: set `HEB_SAT` and `HEB_REESE84` or send cookies to `http://localhost:4321/api/cookies`.
