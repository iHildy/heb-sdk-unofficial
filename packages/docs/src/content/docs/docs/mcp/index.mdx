description: H‑E‑B tools for assistant workflows
---

Connect H‑E‑B shopping tools to AI assistants through MCP.
Run locally over STDIO or host the Streamable HTTP endpoint.

---

## Pick a mode

Remote mode is the default and serves Streamable HTTP at `/mcp` with OAuth and Clerk in front.
Local mode switches to STDIO and starts the cookie bridge on http://localhost:4321.
The bridge is unmaintained; `heb-auth` is the recommended replacement.

Set `MCP_MODE=local` or `MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio` when you want local.

---

## Choose sessions

heb-mcp supports cookie sessions and bearer-token sessions.
Cookie sessions come from logged-in browser cookies, while bearer sessions come from H‑E‑B OAuth.

- Local: set `HEB_SAT` and `HEB_REESE84`, or post cookies to http://localhost:4321/api/cookies
- Hosted: visit `/connect` to link H‑E‑B OAuth, or post cookies to `/api/cookies` with a Clerk bearer token

Use `heb_get_session_info` or `session://status` to confirm you are linked.

---

## Scan capabilities

The tools cover search, carts, orders, lists, store context, delivery, weekly ads, and the homepage feed.

- Session and context: `heb_get_session_info`, `heb_set_store`, `heb_set_shopping_context`, resource `session://status`
- Search and detail: `heb_search_products`, `heb_get_product`, `heb_get_homepage`
- Cart: `heb_get_cart`, `heb_add_to_cart`, `heb_update_cart_item`, `heb_remove_from_cart`
- Account: `heb_get_account_details`
- Orders and lists: `heb_get_order_history`, `heb_get_order_details`, `heb_get_shopping_lists`, `heb_get_shopping_list`, `heb_get_buy_it_again`
- Fulfillment: `heb_get_delivery_slots`, `heb_reserve_slot`, `heb_get_curbside_slots`, `heb_reserve_curbside_slot`
- Stores and ads: `heb_search_stores`, `heb_get_weekly_ad`, `heb_get_weekly_ad_categories`

Pass `response_format: "json"` to include structured output alongside markdown.
Use filters on `heb_get_homepage` unless you want a huge payload.
