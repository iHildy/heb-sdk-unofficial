description: H‑E‑B tools for assistant workflows
---

Connect H‑E‑B shopping tools to AI assistants through MCP.
Run locally over STDIO or host the Streamable HTTP endpoint.

---

## Pick a mode

Remote mode is the default and serves Streamable HTTP at `/mcp` with OAuth and Clerk in front.
Local mode switches to STDIO and starts the cookie bridge on http://localhost:4321.
The bridge is unmaintained; `heb-auth` is the recommended replacement.

Set `MCP_MODE=local` or `MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio` when you want local.

---

## Choose sessions

heb-mcp supports cookie sessions and bearer-token sessions.
Cookie sessions use authorized session cookies, while bearer sessions come from H‑E‑B OAuth.

- Hosted: visit `/connect` to link H‑E‑B OAuth, or post authorized cookies to `/api/cookies` with a Clerk bearer token
- Local: set the required session env vars, or post authorized cookies to http://localhost:4321/api/cookies

Use `heb_get_session_info` or `session://status` to confirm you are linked.
